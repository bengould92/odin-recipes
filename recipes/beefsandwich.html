    <h4>Description</h4> 
    <p>"I tried to combine the traditional Italian beef sandwich with the French dip sandwich with a little nod to the pulled pork sandwich.</p> 
    <p>Instead of using thinly sliced roast beef, I used stew beef, with apologies to my friends from Chicago!"</p> 
       
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds boneless beef chuck, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>4 ciabatta rolls, sliced in half</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped giardiniera (pickled Italian vegetables)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Season beef with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Heat vegetable oil in a heavy pot over high heat. Cook and stir beef in hot oil until browned, 5 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Stir garlic, vinegar, oregano, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, thyme, rosemary, 1 teaspoon black pepper, bay leaf, and red pepper flakes into beef. Pour enough chicken broth into beef mixture to cover the meat by 1 inch and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Cover pot with a lid, reduce heat to low, and simmer until meat is fork-tender, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer meat with a strainer or slotted spoon to a separate pot; pour about 1/4 cup of meat broth into pot. Use a wooden spoon to gently break meat into smaller chunks. Cover pot with a lid or aluminum foil and keep warm.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Skim excess grease from top of broth remaining in the first pot; season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover pot with a lid or aluminum foil and keep broth warm.</li>
        <br>
        <li> Lay halves of a roll out on a work surface and spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons meat broth over each half. Top bottom half of roll with a generous portion of meat and a spoonful of pickled vegetables. Place tops on sandwich. Repeat with remaining buns, broth, meat, and pickled vegetables to make 3 more sandwiches.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Spoon hot meat broth into ramekins and top each ramekin with 1/2 teaspoon parsley. Serve sandwiches with hot broth for dipping.</li>
            
    </ol>
